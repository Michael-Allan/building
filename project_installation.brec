            + Ensure the path to its installation directory is exported as
              environment variable `JDK_HOME`.
                >+ echo $JDK_HOME
                    / ⇒  /opt/jdk-15
                if( necessary )
                    + Add the equivalent of following to your login initializer,
                      e.g. `~/.profile`, `~/.bash_profile` or what have you.

                          JDK_HOME=/var/unbak/opt/jdk-15
                          export JDK_HOME

            + Confirm the JDK commands are accessible.
                >+ $JDK_HOME/bin/javac --version
                        / ⇒  javac 15

                / The command directory is where project installations are accessible by their
                  proper paths.  The present project, for example, will shortly be accessible
                  at `building/Makeshift`.
